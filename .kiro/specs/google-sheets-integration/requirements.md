# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the existing dynamic form with Google Sheets to automatically store all form submissions. The form currently collects user data (name, contact info, social media platforms, social media handle, and agreements) but only logs the data to the console. We need to send this data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for storage and analysis, while maintaining the current user experience and ensuring the integration works seamlessly with the Vercel hosting environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a form administrator, I want all form submissions to be automatically saved to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, so that I can easily view, analyze, and manage the collected data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes and submits the form THEN the system SHALL send all form data to a designated Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. WHEN the form data is sent to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL include essential fields: name, contact method(s), email (if provided), phone (if provided), social media platforms, and social media handle
3. WHEN the data is written to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp of when the submission was received
4. WHEN the Google Sheets integration fails THEN the system SHALL still show the success message to the user to maintain user experience
5. WHEN the Google Sheets integration fails THEN the system SHALL log the error for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a form administrator, I want the Google Sheets data to be well-organized and readable, so that I can easily understand and work with the submitted information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is written to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL format multi-select answers (platforms, contact methods) as comma-separated readable labels
2. WHEN data is written to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL use clear column headers that match the form question titles
3. WHEN data is written to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL format the contact information clearly, showing both the selected methods and the provided details
4. WHEN data is written to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL exclude agreement/consent fields and only store essential form data
5. WHEN data is written to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL append new submissions as new rows without overwriting existing data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Google Sheets integration to be secure and configurable, so that sensitive credentials are protected and the system can be easily deployed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use environment variables to store Google Sheets API credentials securely
2. WHEN the Google Sheets integration is configured THEN the system SHALL use service account authentication rather than user OAuth
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required Google Sheets configuration is present
4. WHEN the Google Sheets API returns an error THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the user experience
5. WHEN the system connects to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL use the minimum required permissions for writing data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a form user, I want the form submission process to remain fast and reliable, so that my experience is not negatively impacted by the Google Sheets integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL not increase the perceived submission time by more than 2 seconds
2. WHEN the Google Sheets API is slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL still show the success message to the user within a reasonable time
3. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL handle the Google Sheets integration asynchronously to avoid blocking the user interface
4. WHEN the Google Sheets integration encounters an error THEN the system SHALL not display error messages to the end user
5. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality including the success animation and message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to monitor and troubleshoot the Google Sheets integration, so that I can ensure data is being collected reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Google Sheets integration processes a submission THEN the system SHALL log successful operations for monitoring
2. WHEN the Google Sheets integration encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the submission data
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity to the Google Sheets API and log the status
4. WHEN a submission fails to write to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL include enough information in logs to retry the operation manually if needed
5. WHEN the Google Sheets integration is configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to set up the required credentials and permissions
